Calendar
====================================

__A date and time picker for the Foundation CSS framework.__


##Introduction

Noting that the Foundation CSS Framework was lacking in the world of date and time picking, this project is an attempt to make the date and time picking process smoother and more considerate of the needs of both the user and the backend data handling system.

Having used the Date/Time picker for other frameworks, and noting that Foundation really only had one option that seemed functional, I decided to create one from the grond up. 

The most popular option out there has one issue that was always difficult to get over: __the input field was used as the display field__.  

This causes an issue because the user will want to see a more friendly, human readable date format (e.g. January 1, 1970 @ 2:00 pm), while the system managing the data will do better handling the date in a more easily parsed format (e.g. 1970-01-01 14:00:00).

Which is exactly why I created Calendar, for the Foundation CSS framework.
